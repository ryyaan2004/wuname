Join Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, Method Man, RZA, GZA, Raekwon and the late Ol' Dirty Bastard using WuNameAAS (Wu-Tang Clan Name Generator As A Service). 

Enter the Wu-Tang (at least in name) with this modern, RESTful, scalable solution to the problem.

Try out one of the apis and gain some street cred.

## Inspiration

The idea was heavily inspired by the original [Wu-Tang Clan Name Generator](http://www.mess.be/inickgenwuname.php). 

A basic idea of how this works along with a starter list of nouns and adjectives was taken from [here](http://www.blazonry.com/name_generator/wuname_how.php).
 
Template for the project was taken from [FOAAS](http://foaas.com)
